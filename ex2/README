# Product Management Using Binary Search Tree (BST)

## Description
This project implements a product management system using a binary search tree
 (BST) in C. The BST allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval
  of product information based on unique product identifiers.

## Features
- **Efficient Product Management**: Utilize a BST for quick access to product details.
- **Product Operations**: Supports adding, removing, and searching for products.
- **Modular Code Structure**: Separated into multiple C files for better maintainability.

## Files
- **CMakeLists.txt**: CMake configuration file for building the project.
- **main.c**: Contains the main function to run the application.
- **ProductBST.c**: Implementation of the binary search tree operations.
- **ProductBST.h**: Header file defining the BST interface and data structures.

## How to Build
1. Ensure you have CMake installed (minimum version 3.16).
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following commands:
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```
4. The executable will be generated in the `build` directory.


## Dependencies
- **CMake**: Version 3.16 or higher.
- **C Compiler**: A compiler supporting C11 standard.

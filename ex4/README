# Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network Library

This is a lightweight C++ library designed to create and train a multilayer
 perceptron (MLP) neural network. The library supports customizable activation
  functions and dense layers, making it suitable for a variety of machine
   learning tasks.

## Features
- **Modular Design**: Easily extendable with new activation functions and layers.
- **Efficiency**: Optimized for performance and small to medium-sized datasets.
- **Scalability**: Supports adding multiple layers and nodes to build complex models.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (C++11 or newer)
- CMake (for building the project)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mlp_network.git
    cd mlp_network
    ```

2. Build the project using CMake:
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```

### Usage
Include the necessary headers in your project:
```cpp
#include "Matrix.h"
#include "Activation.h"
#include "Dense.h"
#include "MlpNetwork.h"
